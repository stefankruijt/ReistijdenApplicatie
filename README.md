ReistijdenApplicatie
====================
***
WARNING: I wrote this application many years ago with a time constraint of 40 hours. Currently (May 2017) after many years I'm going through this code and rewriting it. The master branch still contains the old code and isn't comporable at all with the quality I consider "good code". Feel free to take a look on the "development" branch to see what's going on.

This application visualizes traffic conditions around Amsterdam. I wrote this applicaton as a programming task for a job interview in 40 hours.
